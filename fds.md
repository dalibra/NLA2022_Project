# Blockchain Transactions Analysis Application, Team 9
The repository for final project at Introduction to Blockchain at Skoltech - "Blockchain Transactions Analysis Application".

A software for trading evaluation, and estimation of transactions success. The key element is the collection of database of transactions and quotes from all over the blockchain. In the first stages of the study we assembled a database of blocks that store data on all wallets, tokens, quotes, etc. Then we implemented a program that translates the data we need into Pandas tables and outputs graphs. We use a function called PNL to evaluate trading. It denotes the volume of tokens we gained or lost when trading. On its basis the trader can evaluate his operations and improve his performance.

Main results of the work:
- the entire blockchain was parsed;
- the data about quotes and transactions is stored at our backend databases;
- the data is being processed and finally shows the transaction history.
