# NLA2022 Final Project, Team Achilles
The repository for final project (NLA course) - "A connection between sparse and low-rank matrices and its application to manifold learning"

Main results of the work:
- Explored a geometrical connection between sparse and low-rank matrices.
- The algorithms for Sparse similarity matching and Locally linear extension were implemented from scratch.
- On MNIST dataset the algorithm discovers much lower dimensional representations which preserve meanings.
